# Tinder-bot-using-selenium

A Tinder bot to automate likes and dislikes. This bot uses following features to avoid getting detected and behave more like a human:

  1) It not only swipes right but also swipes left ocassionally ( right swipes are significantly larger than left swipes)
  2) Random wait between likes and dislikes to make it look like a human.
  3) The bot waits for 10 mins after right swiping people in a multiple of 100.
